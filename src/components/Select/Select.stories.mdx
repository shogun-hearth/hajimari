# TODO: Component name

**DATE ADDED**: 03/29/2022 | **PROJECT**: [Project name with link to Notion, Figma, etc]

**TODO** -- A `Select` is a dropdown menu that allows the user to choose one or multiple items
in a list of items and then displays the selected item(s) in an input field.

<br />

<br />

### Usage and examples

**TODO** -- add a more technical description of the component here, which will generally be some information
about the available props; this can be listed as a table:

<br />

#### Default / Basic:

> Short description of the basic use case of this component. Include a code snippet and canvas.

```
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic">{component}<Story>
</Canvas>
```

<Canvas>
    <Story
      name="Basic"
      args={{ name: "Select", label: "Label", items: selectOptions }}
    >
      {StoryTemplate.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Variants

**TODO** -- add other variants / usage examples here, following the same format as the "Basic" example.

### Playground

**TODO** -- This is where the component will actually be rendered with [interactive controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls/). There should be a control
for each prop that someone can change (i.e. background color, border color, width, or whatever else is appropriate for a given
component).

```
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Playground">{component}</Story>
</Canvas>
```

<Canvas>
    <Story
      name="Playground"
      args={{ name: "Select", label: "Label", items: selectOptions }}
    >
      {StoryTemplate.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

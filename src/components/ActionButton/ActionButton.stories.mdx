# TODO: ActionButton

**DATE ADDED**: September 6, 2022 | **PROJECT**: https://gethearth.atlassian.net/browse/ROK-1146

The Action Button is a slightly more specific button that will be used in the Action Button Group component.
Action Buttons can be full width or smaller so that they line up horizontally.

### Usage and examples

**TODO** -- add a more technical description of the component here, which will generally be some information
about the available props; this can be listed as a table:

<br />

#### Default / Basic:

> Short description of the basic use case of this component. Include a code snippet and canvas.

```
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic">{component}<Story>
</Canvas>
```

#### Variants

**TODO** -- add other variants / usage examples here, following the same format as the "Basic" example.

### Sandbox

**TODO** -- This is where the component will actually be rendered with [interactive controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls/). There should be a control
for each prop that someone can change (i.e. background color, border color, width, or whatever else is appropriate for a given
component).

```
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sandbox">{component}</Story>
</Canvas>
```
